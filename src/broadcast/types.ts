   *   signal flips `true` only after `gracePeriod` ms have elapsed since gaining
   *   leadership — *unless* this tab is alone (no observed peers at election time),
   *   in which case the flip is synchronous (no useless wait on single-tab loads).
   *
   * Use to gate work that shouldn't fire during election ambiguity — e.g., RTK
   * Query's `skip: !isStableBroadcaster.current` prevents the new leader from
   * firing a fresh request the instant after election when the former leader's
   * trailing data might still be in flight.

  /**

   * The delay gives existing peers a window to respond to our initial `hello`
   * with their own heartbeats. Without it, a tab joining an existing session
   * transiently self-elects before any peer heartbeats arrive, producing a
   * visible flicker of `isBroadcaster` from `false → true → false`.
   *
   * The default scales with `heartbeatInterval` automatically — one full
   * heartbeat cycle plus a 100ms jitter buffer — so raising the heartbeat
   * never silently shrinks the anti-flicker window. While the window is
   * pending, heartbeat ticks don't claim leadership (yielding still works),
   * so the configured delay is honored exactly.
   *
   * Set to `0` to elect synchronously (lone-tab scenarios; fastest, accepts
   * the flicker). Explicit values < `heartbeatInterval` risk the flicker
   * described above.
